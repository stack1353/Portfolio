Running YOLO on Raspberry Pi requires balancing accuracy with compute limits. Tips:

- Use smaller variants and INT8 quantization where possible
- Leverage the IMX477 sensor controls for cleaner frames
- Batch post-processing and limit overlays to maintain FPS

With proper tuning, real-time detection is achievable for many use-cases.
